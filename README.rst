This is a fairly rudimentary automated text generator that uses a Markov model to generate
fake tweets for any user on Twitter.

You will also need your own access to Twitter's api and have the following credentials:
- consumer_key
- consumer_secret
- access_token
- access_token_secret

And to use it check out example_code.py
